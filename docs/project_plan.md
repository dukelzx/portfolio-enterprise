# Project Plan

**Project Goal:**  
Enterprise-grade personal portfolio website showcasing professional skills and four key projects.

**Core Pages:**  
- `index.html` – Home / Introduction  
- `projects.html` – Portfolio projects  
- `contact.html` – Contact form

**Required Features:**  
- Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)  
- Basic SEO (meta tags, semantic HTML)  
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)  
- Deployment via GitHub Pages

**Non-functional Goals:**  
- Lighthouse performance ≥ 90  
- First contentful paint ≤ 1s  
- Clean, modular, maintainable code

**Timeline (2-week sprint) with Visual Status:**

| Week | Task | Status / Priority |
|------|------|-----------------|
| 1    | Environment setup & version control | ✅ High |
| 1    | Base layout & navigation | ⚡ Medium |
| 1    | Responsive design implementation | ⚡ Medium |
| 2    | Projects page development | ⚡ Medium |
| 2    | Contact page & form validation | ⏳ Low |
| 2    | SEO & accessibility refinements | ⏳ Low |
| 2    | Performance optimization & GitHub Pages deployment | ✅ High |

**Risks & Mitigation:**  
- Large images → Compress / lazy-load  
- Form abuse → Validation or CAPTCHA  
- Cross-browser issues → Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
